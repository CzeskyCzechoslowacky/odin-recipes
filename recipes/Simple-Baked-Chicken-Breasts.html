<p><div class="all">Learn how to bake chicken that's tender, juicy, and perfect every time with this simple, 5-ingredient recipe for boneless, skinless chicken breasts. 
    Adding just a bit of chicken broth to those beautiful pan drippings creates a tasty pan sauce that adds extra flavor at the table.</p>
<p> "I made this a few weeks ago and will make it again today for dinner," says joan.</p>
<p> "Quick and tender — and leftovers are just as good! For spices, 
    I used a basic blend I found in one of the reviews with a little extra cayenne for my heat-loving husband. 
    Do not overcook, remove from the oven, tent with foil and rest for ten minutes or so. Mmmm!"</p>
<p> "Great recipe to hold onto specifically for cooking time and temp," according to cmartire.</p>
<p> "Comes out moist and perfect every time. You can use any spice mixture."</p>   
<p> "This is my 'go-to' chicken recipe," says bb2cook.</p>
<p> "We have it often. I change up the seasonings, and use lemon flavored olive oil. 
    The cooking time does vary according to the size of the chicken breast so check the internal temperature often. 
    It is always moist and flavorful and so easy."</div></p>   
   
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 (5 ounce) skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon coarse sea salt, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 pinch Creole seasoning (such as Tony Chachere's®), or more to taste</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
</ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <img src="step1.webp" alt="Step 1">
    <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Rub chicken breasts with olive oil and sprinkle both sides with salt and Creole seasoning. Place chicken in a broiler pan.</li>
        <img src="step3.webp" alt="Step 3">
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. 
        Flip chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <img src="step4.webp" alt="Step 4">
    <li>Remove chicken to a plate.</li>
    <li>Pour chicken broth into the pan and scrape any browned bits off the bottom with a flat-edged wooden spatula. 
        Add more broth if needed to dislodge the browned bits, but not too much or it will be watery.</li>
        <img src="step6.webp" alt="Step 6">
    <li>To serve, drizzle the pan sauce over the chicken.</li>
