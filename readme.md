#Project Odin Recipes
In this project, you are going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
I will use basic TAG's of HTML.
For example:
Connect between pages of the site using "link"
Adding images on pages using "img src -with- alt"
